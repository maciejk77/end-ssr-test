## End React SSR test

This project serves SSR React component

### Instruction

- `git clone` the project
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn dev` to run (if any problems run, stop and run again on first attempt - bundle needs to be build)
- visit `localhost:3000` to preview

### Requirements

- server-side render new navigation component from an Express server
- use the data the same way as if it was an api request that had to be made on the server first
- hover functionality with a hover
- split the data into columns, consider the include_in_menu, include_in_menu_column2, include_in_menu_column3 attribute

### Considerations

- the dropdowns functioning (hidden, then revealed on hover)
- any loading of manipulation of data as required
- the thought process behind structure of the code (especially the breakdown of components) and the reasons behind the choices
